# Developing data products

This is the Shiny code for the Data Products Coursera course taught by
John Hopkins University.

## Synopsis

This is the user-interface definition of a Shiny web application that
illustrates the effect of noise on a signal. The shiny app is deployed
at
[this shinyapps website](https://marchdf.shinyapps.io/DataProducts/)

## Project instructions and guidelines

### Your Shiny Application
1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting
   documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a
   user will need to get started using your application.

1. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
1. Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
1. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github


The application must include the following:

1. Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
1. Some operation on the ui input in server.R
1. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
1. You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
1. The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.

The Shiny application in question is entirely up to you. However, if
you're having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from the
simple prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm on
one of the R datasets packages. Please make the package simple for the
end user, so that they don't need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge
to evaluate your application. You should emphasize a simple project
given the short time frame.


### Your Reproducible Pitch Presentation

OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You
get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch a your
app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio
Presenter with an html5 slide deck.

Here's what you need

1. 5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
1. Your presentation pushed to github or Rpubs
1. A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the provided text box

Your presentation must satisfy the following

1. It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
1. It must be 5 pages
1. It must be hosted on github or Rpubs
1. It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document
